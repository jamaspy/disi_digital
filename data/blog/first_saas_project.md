Hey there, fellow developers! I've embarked on an exciting new journey, and I can't wait to share the details with you all.

Recently, I decided to build a SaaS platform called Stackshow, a digital sales room where salespeople can create and send high-fidelity sales documents to their potential clients after a meeting or call.

Now, you might be wondering, "Why Stackshow, and why did you choose this particular tech stack?" Well, let me break it down for you.

My goal with Stackshow is to provide a faster and more intuitive solution for salespeople to follow up with prospects. While there are other platforms on the market, Stackshow aims to stand out with its lightning-fast performance, thanks to its tech stack. At the core, we have **NextJS**, a **React** framework that delivers "blazing-fast" speeds and a seamless user experience. Coupled with **Tailwind CSS**, we'll be crafting a stunning and responsive UI that will leave your prospects impressed.

One key decision I made was to ditch **Prisma**, as I found it to be a bit sluggish. Instead, I'm relying on the power of **Xata**, a robust backend-as-a-service solution that will handle our data needs with ease and efficiency.

But that's not all! We're also leveraging the power of **Vercel**, a cutting-edge platform that provides **edge caching/functions**, ensuring that our application remains "lightning-fast" and responsive, no matter where our users are accessing it from. And let's not forget about the integration of **OpenAI's** language model, which will add a touch of artificial intelligence magic to our platform, making it even more intuitive and user-friendly.

This carefully curated tech stack is the perfect recipe for creating a powerful SaaS platform that will streamline the sales process and make it more engaging for both parties involved. With its focus on speed, intuitive design, and AI-powered assistance, Stackshow is poised to become a game-changer in the sales industry.

As we continue to develop and refine Stackshow, I'm excited to explore new possibilities and push the boundaries of what a digital sales room can offer. Stay tuned for updates, as we plan to incorporate even more cutting-edge technologies and features to enhance the user experience further.

Lastly, I want to extend an open invitation to all developers out there. If you're passionate about building innovative solutions and pushing the limits of what's possible, join me on this journey. Together, we can create something truly remarkable and shape the future of sales technology.
