When I first stumbled into the tech world, I knew I’d found my passion. Moving from recruitment to development was a leap of faith, but it sparked a fire in me that’s been burning ever since. Now, I’m diving headfirst into Web3 and mobile development—two spaces I believe are the inevitable future of the internet.

History has shown us the evolution from Web1 to Web2, and with the rise of real-world applications for cryptocurrencies and DeFi, Web3 is the next logical step. Whether it’s the American government leaning pro-crypto or Dubai’s DMCC announcing the groundbreaking [‘Crypto Tower’](https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-ae/business-news/dubai-announces-launch-of-worlds-first-ever-crypto-tower/485621#:~:text=DMCC%20and%20REIT%20Development%2C%20have,for%20innovation%20and%20advanced%20technologies.), the momentum is undeniable. Web3 represents a shift toward decentralization, ownership, and innovation that’s impossible to ignore. And let’s face it, these technologies will thrive on mobile. In a fast-paced world, we need solutions that are portable, quick, and accessible from anywhere, empowering people to engage with the future on the go.

With 6 years of experience under my belt, I’ve honed my skills working with cutting-edge full-stack technologies. I’ve built robust applications using modern tools and frameworks, consistently staying ahead of industry trends. While my mobile development experience could use a refresh, the solid foundation I’ve built gives me the confidence to dive back in seamlessly and tackle new challenges head-on. Staying relevant in this industry means constantly evolving, something I’ve embraced wholeheartedly. The rapid adoption of AI, with tools like [v0](https://v0.dev/), [bolt](https://bolt.new/), [copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), is a reminder that no role is untouchable. Developers who adapt and leverage these tools will thrive, delivering higher-quality code faster and more efficiently. Web3 adds another layer of opportunity, offering decentralized frameworks that enhance transparency, security, and user control. By integrating blockchain technology, developers can build solutions that are not only efficient but also resistant to single points of failure, creating a more robust and user-centric approach to modern development.

**To kickstart my Web3 development journey, I’m focusing on three fundamental skills that form the backbone of this innovative space:**

**Blockchain Basics:** Understanding how blockchains work is crucial—from the structure of transactions to how decentralized ledgers ensure security and transparency. I’ll dive deep into Ethereum, the most widely-used blockchain for dApps, and explore its key features like smart contracts and gas fees.

**Smart Contracts with [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/):** The go-to programming language for writing smart contracts on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/). Learning how to create, deploy, and interact with smart contracts will be a priority, as they are the heart of Web3 applications.

**Wallets and dApp Integration:** Web3 is all about decentralization and wallets like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/en-au/wallet) are critical in giving users control over their digital assets. I’ll focus on how to connect dApps to wallets, enabling seamless user interaction in a secure environment.

This blog is my way of documenting my journey and holding myself accountable. I want to inspire others -especially self-taught devs - to embrace challenges, take risks, and evolve alongside the tech landscape. The future isn’t just coming; it’s here, and I’m ready to build it. Are you?
