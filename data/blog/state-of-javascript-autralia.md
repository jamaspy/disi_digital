In 2024, the JavaScript ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly, with several key trends shaping the landscape of frameworks and libraries. React.js remains the most popular and widely used framework, retaining its dominance thanks to its robust ecosystem and large community support. However, emerging technologies and frameworks are starting to gain traction, offering developers new tools and approaches to modern web development.

One of the most notable trends is the increasing adoption of Next.js, which has moved from being a niche tool to a mainstream framework. Next.js is particularly valued for its ability to handle server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which improve performance and SEO. Its seamless integration with React and built-in features like image optimization and API routes have made it a favorite among developers looking to build fast, scalable applications​(

Svelte and SvelteKit are also gaining popularity as alternatives to React, offering a more lightweight and efficient approach to building web applications. Svelte’s compiler-based framework results in faster load times and smaller bundle sizes, which is increasingly important as users demand quicker, more responsive web experiences. Although not as widely adopted as React, Svelte is being recognized for its simplicity and performance advantages.

Another trend is the rise of Micro Frontends, an architectural style that allows teams to work independently on different parts of an application, which are then integrated into a cohesive whole. This approach is gaining traction in large-scale applications where scalability and maintainability are critical​(

In Australia, frontend developers specializing in React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript command some of the highest salaries, often ranging from AUD 120,000 to AUD 160,000 annually, with top roles in fintech and e-commerce sectors offering even higher compensation​(
